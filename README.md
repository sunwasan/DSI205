# DSI205 (2/2022)
### DSI205 Group Project: Least-Squares Problem Project
<hr>

**Project**  
1.) 4-5 people per group  
2.) Find a dataset from UCI (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) or Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)**Make sure the dataset you picked has continuous attributes.  
3.) Apply Linear Regression Techniques on the data you picked.
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
  <li>Split data into 2 groups: use one group for finding linear regression parameters and another for computing the RMSE only.</li>
  <li>Try different splits of data (or cross validation); other regression techniques such as SVM, Ridge regression, Lasso; different metrics, e.g., R2, MAE. Submit report and code via MS Team by 26 Apr 2023, 11.59 PM.</li>
</ul>
